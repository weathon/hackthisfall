# Meeting Paw

Meeting Paw is your intelligent meeting assistant, designed to enhance productivity and engagement. It actively listens to discussions, provides real-time summaries of key points, and interacts dynamically with meeting content, including on-screen presentations. Additionally, it features a virtual whiteboard where users can draw in the air using finger gestures. The agent also has access to the internet and can retrieve information from internal document databases to support discussions effectively.
